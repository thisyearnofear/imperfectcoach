# Demo Script

**Imperfect Coach - Autonomous AI Fitness Agent with Multi-Chain Payments**

> 🎯 **Target Time: 3 minutes**

## 🎬 Opening Hook (0:00-0:20)

**Narrative:** "What if your fitness coach was an AI agent that could make autonomous economic decisions?"

**Visual:** Show the app interface with both Base and Solana wallet connections.

**Script:**
"Meet Imperfect Coach - the first AI agent that makes intelligent payment routing decisions. While other agents simply pay, ours optimizes costs in real-time across multiple blockchains."

## 🏋️ Feature Demo 1: Pull-up Analysis (0:20-1:00)

**Narrative:** "Let me show you how it works with a pull-up workout."

**Actions:**
1. Connect Solana wallet (Phantom)
2. Select "Pull-ups" exercise
3. Complete 5 pull-ups with form feedback
4. Show real-time form scoring (78%)
5. Click "Unlock AI Coach Agent" ($0.10)

**Script:**
"Watch as our AI agent decides which tools to use. It's analyzing your form, checking your history, benchmarking against peers, and generating a personalized plan - all autonomously."

**Visual:** Show CloudWatch logs with agent reasoning steps:
```
🤖 Starting REAL Agent Analysis with Bedrock AgentCore...
🔄 Agent iteration 1/5 - Analyzing pose data
🔧 Executing tool: analyze_pose_data
🔄 Agent iteration 2/5 - Querying workout history
🔧 Executing tool: query_workout_history
```

## 💰 Feature Demo 2: Smart Payment Routing (1:00-1:40)

**Narrative:** "Here's where it gets interesting - autonomous payment optimization."

**Actions:**
1. Show payment selection modal with cost comparison
2. Highlight Solana option: "Save 90% on fees"
3. Complete x402 payment with Solana wallet
4. Show transaction confirmation

**Script:**
"For micro-payments like this $0.001 tip, the agent automatically selects Solana - saving 90% in fees. For larger payments, it offers user choice with live cost comparison."

**Visual:** Show transaction on Solana Explorer:
```
✅ Transaction confirmed
🔗 https://explorer.solana.com/tx/...
📤 0.001 USDC transferred
💰 90% fee savings vs Ethereum
```

## 🤖 Feature Demo 3: Multi-Chain Intelligence (1:40-2:20)

**Narrative:** "The agent adapts to different payment contexts."

**Actions:**
1. Show $0.05 premium analysis - user choice between chains
2. Show $0.10 agent coaching - automatic Base selection
3. Explain reasoning: "Established infrastructure for complex operations"

**Script:**
"For premium analysis, you choose. For agent coaching, it intelligently selects Base - leveraging established infrastructure for complex multi-step reasoning."

## 🏆 Feature Demo 4: On-Chain Leaderboard (2:20-2:40)

**Narrative:** "All your progress is permanently recorded on-chain."

**Actions:**
1. Submit score to leaderboard
2. Show transaction confirmation
3. Refresh leaderboard to show new entry

**Script:**
"Every workout is permanently recorded on the blockchain. No centralized database - just immutable proof of your progress."

## 🎯 Closing & Value Proposition (2:40-3:00)

**Narrative:** "Why this matters for the Solana x402 Hackathon."

**Script:**
"This isn't just another fitness app - it's a working AI agent that makes autonomous economic decisions. While other hackathon projects prototype, we've built a production-ready system that demonstrates true autonomous economic intelligence.

We're redefining what it means to be an x402 agent - from simple payment user to intelligent payment optimizer."

**Visual:** Show all three value propositions:
1. ✅ Working Agent (vs. prototypes)
2. ✅ Proven x402 (enhanced integration)
3. ✅ Smart Economic Decisions (first autonomous payment routing)

## 🎤 Presentation Tips

### Technical Details to Highlight
- **Multi-step reasoning**: Show CloudWatch logs with agent iterations
- **Tool integration**: Demonstrate 4 different tools being used autonomously
- **Payment optimization**: Emphasize 90% fee savings
- **Real transactions**: Show actual Solana Explorer links

### Common Questions to Prepare For
1. **"How does the agent decide which chain to use?"**
   Answer: Context-aware routing based on transaction value and complexity.

2. **"Is this actually saving money?"**
   Answer: Yes - show live cost comparison and transaction fees.

3. **"How does the AI coaching work?"**
   Answer: Multi-step reasoning with autonomous tool selection and execution.

### Backup Demo Options
If live demo fails:
1. Show pre-recorded video of agent reasoning
2. Display CloudWatch logs with successful transactions
3. Show Solana Explorer with real transactions
4. Present architecture diagrams

## 📊 Success Metrics

### What Judges Should See
- ✅ Autonomous AI agent making decisions
- ✅ Multi-chain payment optimization
- ✅ Real on-chain transactions
- ✅ Working implementation (not just concept)

### Key Differentiators
1. **Working Agent**: Sophisticated AI vs. hackathon prototypes
2. **Smart Payments**: Autonomous routing vs. simple payments
3. **Multi-Chain**: True cross-chain intelligence
4. **Production Ready**: Complete system vs. demo components
