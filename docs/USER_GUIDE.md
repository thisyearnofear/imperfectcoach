**Example Agent Analysis:**
```
Agent Reasoning Chain:
1. 🎯 Analyzed pose data → Detected form asymmetry
2. 📊 Checked workout history → Pattern confirmed over 8 sessions
3. 🏆 Benchmarked performance → You're at 75th percentile
4. 🗓️ Generated training plan → 4-week corrective program

Your Personalized Plan:
Week 1-2: Unilateral strength focus
  - Single-arm rows: 3x8 each side
  - Asymmetry correction drills
  - Form emphasis over volume

Week 3-4: Progressive overload
  - Weighted pull-ups: 3x5
  - Volume increase: +10%
  - Maintain strict form standards

Agent's Insights:
"Your right side is compensating by 8%. This is limiting your 
progress despite good overall strength. Focus on single-arm work 
to balance out, then you'll see rapid improvement."
