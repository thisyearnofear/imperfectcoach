This document outlines the strategic roadmap to evolve the Imperfect Coach from its current MVP state to a production-ready, autonomous on-chain coaching business, as envisioned in the `HACKATHON_PLAN.md`.

The focus is on creating a **DRY, performant, modular, and intuitive** codebase.

---

## Phase 1: Solidify the Core Architecture (Modularity & Performance) âœ… COMPLETE

This phase focused on establishing distinct systems for the free and paid tiers, ensuring performance and creating a clean separation of concerns.

### **1. Two-Tier Backend System âœ… IMPLEMENTED**

- **Free Tier (Real-Time):** **Supabase Edge Functions** handle low-latency AI coaching (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) with fallback messaging when services are unavailable.
- **Paid Tier (Deep Dive):** **AWS Lambda function** (`imperfect-coach-premium-analysis`) deployed in `eu-north-1` handles premium analysis using Amazon Nova Lite with x402 payment gating.
- **Benefits Achieved:**
  - **Performance:** Expensive Bedrock analysis separated from real-time feedback system.
  - **Modularity:** Clean separation of free and premium product logic.
  - **Cost-Efficiency:** Independent optimization of infrastructure for each service.

### 2. Smart Contract Suite âœ… DEPLOYED

All contracts are production-ready and deployed to Base Sepolia:

- **`ImperfectCoachPassport.sol`:** âœ… Deployed at `0x7c95712a2bce65e723cE99C190f6bd6ff73c4212`
  - Non-transferable (soulbound) design implemented.
  - `updatePassport` function strictly permissioned to `CoachOperator` only.

- **`CoachOperator.sol`:** âœ… Deployed at `0xdEc2d60c9526106a8e4BBd01d70950f6694053A3`
  - Acts as the on-chain agent with authority to call `updatePassport`.
  - Configured as the operator for the ImperfectCoachPassport contract.

- **`RevenueSplitter.sol`:** âœ… Deployed at `0x6C9BCfF8485B12fb8bd73B77638cd6b2dD0CF9CA`
  - Receives and holds funds from user payments (`x402pay`).
  - Implements `distribute()` function for Platform Treasury (70%), User Rewards (20%), and Referrers (10%).
  - Permission system in place with `CoachOperator` as initial owner.

---

## Phase 2: Implement the Premium User Flow (DRY & Intuitive) âœ… COMPLETE

This phase connected the new architecture with a seamless user experience, focusing on code reuse and clear frontend components.

### **1. Bedrock Integration âœ… IMPLEMENTED**

- **AWS SDK for JavaScript v3:** Integrated within the `premium-analysis` Lambda function deployed in `eu-north-1`.
- **Amazon Nova Lite Model:** Successfully implemented using `amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` for "Deep Dive" fitness analysis.
- **InvokeModel API:** Fully operational, processing workout data and returning detailed performance analysis.
- **Production Status:** Live and functional with 3-second response times, 30-second timeout configuration.

### **2. x402pay-Gated Endpoint âœ… DEPLOYED**

- **Endpoint:** `https://viaqmsudab.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/analyze-workout`
- **Integration:** AWS Lambda function with Amazon Nova Lite integration and CORS configuration.
- **Status:** Live and functional with mock payment verification (ready for x402 integration).
- **Performance:** 3-second average response time with detailed AI analysis output.

### **3. "Deep Dive" Flow âœ… ORCHESTRATED**

1. **Frontend:** `PremiumAnalysisUpsell.tsx` component handles "Unlock Deep Dive" with seamless x402 payment flow.
2. **API Call:** Payment triggers workout data submission to AWS Lambda endpoint.
3. **Backend (Lambda):** 
   - ðŸ”„ Payment verification (mock implementation ready for x402 integration)
   - âœ… Invokes Amazon Nova Lite for comprehensive fitness analysis
   - âœ… Returns detailed analysis with actionable feedback and scoring
   - ðŸ”„ On-chain passport updates via `CoachOperator` (ready for implementation)

### 4. DRY Codebase Architecture âœ… ACHIEVED

- **Solution Implemented:** Enhanced fallback systems in AI feedback hooks to prevent service failures.
- **TypeScript Improvements:** Proper type definitions added for `WorkoutData` and `AnalysisResult` interfaces.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly fallback messages.

### 5. Frontend Experience âœ… BUILT

- **Payment UI (x402pay):**
  - âœ… `x402-fetch` library integrated for seamless payment flow
  - âœ… `PremiumAnalysisUpsell.tsx` component created with clear value proposition ($0.25 Deep Dive)
  - âœ… HTTP 402 `Payment Required` challenge handling implemented
  - âœ… Component integrated into post-workout flow

- **`MyPassport` Component:** âœ… Implemented
  - Fetches and renders NFT metadata (`level`, `totalReps`) using `wagmi`/`viem`
  - Serves as centerpiece of user's "My Progress" dashboard
  - Connected to deployed contract addresses

## Phase 3: CDP Wallet Integration & Autonomous Economic Loop ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

This phase elevates the platform to a fully autonomous on-chain business using CDP Wallet for treasury management and automated revenue distribution.

### 1. CDP Wallet Treasury Management ðŸ”„ PLANNING

**Objective:** Transform the platform into an autonomous economic agent that manages its own treasury and automatically distributes revenue.

**Implementation Strategy:**
```typescript
// CDP Wallet becomes the platform's autonomous treasury
const platformWallet = await Wallet.create();

// Auto-route x402 payments to RevenueSplitter
await platformWallet.invokeContract({
  contractAddress: "0x6C9BCfF8485B12fb8bd73B77638cd6b2dD0CF9CA",
  method: "receive",
  args: [paymentAmount]
});

// Auto-trigger revenue distribution
await platformWallet.invokeContract({
  contractAddress: "0x6C9BCfF8485B12fb8bd73B77638cd6b2dD0CF9CA", 
  method: "distribute",
  args: [] // 70/20/10 split to Platform/Rewards/Referrers
});
```

### 2. Automated Revenue Flows ðŸ”„ DESIGNING

**Current State:** Manual x402 payments â†’ AWS endpoint
**Target State:** x402 payments â†’ CDP Wallet â†’ Auto-distribute via RevenueSplitter

**Benefits:**
- **Autonomous Operation:** Platform manages its own treasury without manual intervention
- **Real-time Distribution:** Payments automatically flow to coaches, platform, and rewards pools
- **Transparent Economics:** All financial flows visible on-chain
- **Hackathon Category:** Targets "Best Use of x402pay + CDP Wallet" ($5,000 prize)

### 3. Coach & User Reward Automation ðŸ”„ PLANNED

**Coach Payments:**
```typescript
// Auto-pay coaches based on user engagement metrics
await platformWallet.transfer({
  amount: calculateCoachReward(userEngagement),
  destination: coachWalletAddress,
  asset: "USDC"
});
```

**User Rewards:**
```typescript
// Auto-reward users for consistency and achievements
await platformWallet.transfer({
  amount: achievementReward,
  destination: userWalletAddress,
  asset: "USDC"
});
```

### 4. Platform Self-Funding ðŸ”„ ENVISIONED

**AI Service Costs:**
```typescript
// Platform autonomously pays for AI service costs
await platformWallet.transfer({
  amount: monthlyAICosts,
  destination: aiServiceProvider,
  asset: "USDC"
});
```

**Infrastructure Scaling:**
- Treasury automatically funds new AI models based on usage
- Self-expanding infrastructure based on revenue growth
- Autonomous reinvestment in platform improvements

### 5. On-Chain Referrals & Affiliate System ðŸ”„ FUTURE

- **Enhanced RevenueSplitter:** Extend to manage dynamic referrer addresses and their revenue shares
- **Affiliate Automation:** CDP Wallet automatically pays referrers based on successful conversions
- **Multi-tier Rewards:** Implement coach, user, and referrer reward tiers based on performance metrics
